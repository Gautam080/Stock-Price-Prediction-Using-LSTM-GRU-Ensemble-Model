# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM-GRU-Ensemble-Model
This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to predict stock prices using an ensemble model that integrates LSTM and GRU architectures. The model's performance was optimized with hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.00028.
